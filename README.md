# Objective

Welcome to Akita Engineering!

The goal of this document is to provide contribution guidance and maintain transparency around roles/responsibilities of stakeholders. This document actively accepts pull requests!

At a high level, this living document serves to establish protections for the following stakeholders:
- Akita engineer volunteers, to ensure they understand the obligations with delivering code that is bounty-able, and options to transition code if they do not wish to continue to maintain it.
- The Akita community, such that they feel a bounty was not a hit-n-run, where it was rewarded with no ability to carry the work forward with someone else.
- Akita core members, who should not be under any obligation to continue to host, maintain, and manage multiple open source projects.




# Akita developers

## Bounty Program
Akita Inu ASA has established a bounty program, which rewards individual or teams of engineers with Akita Inu ASA tokens in exchange for code. The community will submit proposals and reward values, and if accepted will become a project in the [engineering discord](https://discord.gg/dzr9cFFD).

The bounty serves as an incentive, however contributors maintain full rights to the code and are free to distribute it to others as they wish. In fact, this is encouraged! Contributors should feel free to distribute their code to other ASAs, (or chains!) if applicable.

## Submission
Once a project is complete, post in the [engineering discord](https://discord.gg/dzr9cFFD) under the channel for the project. Check the discord for guidelines around submission. It's a pretty easy process. :)

## License
Projects are required to include a license, either the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). No other licenses are accepted at this time. Please add a `LICENSE` file at the top level of your project.

## README
Projects are required to include a README, preferably in markdown format, which helps developers and users understand how to work with your project.

## Project Lifecycle
When a bounty program is completed, the developer will share the code with the Akita core team. At this point it will be forked into the [OfficialAkitaInu GitHub repository](https://github.com/OfficialAkitaInu/). However, this serves an archival purpose only. It will point to the actively maintained project, which is where future contributions should go. This protects the community in case a developer receives a bounty and removes their code from GitHub.

If a developer no longer wishes to maintain their code base, that's okay! We would appreciate it if you send us your latest stable version (sync our official repo with yours). At this point the project will be in a "Help Wanted" state, looking for a community member to volunteer to maintain the project moving forward if it still provides value.



# FAQ

## What role does the Akita team have in their engineering projects?
Akita core members assume no responsibility for any of the code produced by the bounty program. OfficialAkitaInu projects exist for archival purposes only to protect the community in case a developer removes their code from GitHub.

## I found a bug / want to open an issue, where should I do that?
Any issues should be opened with the developer in their namespace/project. No PRs will be accepted into the OfficialAkitaInu project, unless it is from the original developer, or updates to this document.

## I created a website/service/bot, who hosts it?
You do, unless explicitly part of the bounty program. Akita core members do not wish to maintain services built by the community. It doesn't scale, and isn't decentralized.


## I no longer want to maintain a project, what do I do?
Please let us sync your latest stable code base, and thanks for your contributions! :)
